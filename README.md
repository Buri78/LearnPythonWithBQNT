# How is this Python Learning Series different from others?
Python is one of the most demanded skills within Financial Industry today. Many people trying to learn Python, however most of the online contents are very engineering and data science oriented and they include topics that may not be used for Financial Analysis as day to day tasks.

This Python Learning Series is intended to provide **comprehensive but very effective way to pick up Python**, with three times a week 30 minutes or less bite-size content, you will learn the skills needed on day to day bases. It skips the complicated but uncommon contents but covers one of the most important pieces: how to download the data from Bloomberg directly with Python.

# Technical Preparation
**NO NEED to manually install Python, Anaconda and Python Packages by yourself**.
If you have Bloomberg software installed, run {BQNT <GO>} on the terminal, you will have everything set up and ready to go. BQNT is open source-based platform, so everything you learned could be applied to other places too. 

# How to download the material and import into BQNT?
